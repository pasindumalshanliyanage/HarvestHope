                <h2>Homepage Implementation Overview</h2>
                <div class="implementation-details">
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The homepage serves as the central hub of the Hungerless website, designed to both engage visitors and provide clear navigation paths to all sections of the site. My implementation focused on creating an impactful first impression while ensuring intuitive usability.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Key HTML Elements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Semantic Structure</strong> - Used semantic HTML5 elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to improve accessibility and SEO.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigation Menu</strong> - Implemented a responsive navigation bar with flexbox for optimal display across devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hero Section</strong> - Created a prominent hero section with a compelling background image and overlay text to immediately convey the site's purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Cards</strong> - Used card-based layout for mission/vision statements and content links to organize information in visually distinct units.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Key CSS Techniques</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexbox Layout</strong> - Used flexbox for responsive layouts that adjust gracefully to different screen sizes.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS Variables</strong> - Implemented CSS variables for consistent color theming across the site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Background Effects</strong> - Applied semi-transparent overlays on background images to ensure text readability while preserving visual appeal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hover Effects & Transitions</strong> - Added subtle animations and transitions to interactive elements to improve user experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Media Queries</strong> - Implemented breakpoints to ensure the site functions effectively on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
                    <p>For the color scheme, I chose a warm and hopeful palette. The main accent color is orange (#D8931D), which is used consistently on buttons, headings, and other interactive elements to draw attention and create visual harmony.</p>
                    
                    <p>The dark background, with its subtle texture, gives the site a modern and professional look while allowing the orange accents to stand out. I carefully positioned and sized the logo for immediate brand recognition, adding a gentle hover effect to indicate that it’s clickable.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, navigation links have a simple underline effect on hover. This reinforces their interactivity without being visually overwhelming, maintaining a clean and polished aesthetic throughout the homepage.</p>

                <div class="implementation-details">
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The Local Food Markets and Distribution page was designed to provide an informative and structured overview of local food systems while ensuring easy navigation and a visually appealing reading experience. My implementation aimed to guide users through complex topics in an organized and engaging manner.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Key HTML Elements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Semantic Headings</strong> - I structured the page using a clear heading hierarchy (h1 for the main title, h2 for section headings) to support readability for both users and screen readers. This approach improves accessibility and SEO.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Navigation Menu</strong> - To enhance user experience, I implemented an internal navigation menu at the top of the content area. This allows visitors to quickly jump to specific sections such as “Benefits of Short Food Distribution Chains” or “Challenges in Local Food Distribution” without excessive scrolling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Section-Based Content Layout</strong> - The content is divided into thematic sections, each marked with its own id to enable anchor link navigation. Each section combines a heading, a relevant image, and descriptive paragraphs to create a balanced, informative layout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Images for Contextual Support</strong> - Each section includes an illustrative image, enhancing understanding of the content and making the reading experience more engaging for visual learners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Back-to-Top Button</strong> - I added a persistent “Back to Top” button at the bottom of the page, enabling users to return to the top effortlessly after reading through long sections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Key CSS Techniques</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexbox Layouts</strong> - Flexbox was used to align and distribute elements within containers, such as the header navigation bar and footer sections, ensuring consistency across screen sizes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive Design with Media Queries</strong> -  Breakpoints were implemented to adjust the layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. This ensures images, headings, and paragraphs resize or stack appropriately without compromising readability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Navigation Styling</strong> - The internal navigation menu is styled distinctly from the main navigation bar, ensuring clear differentiation. Hover effects were added to links to indicate interactivity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Image Styling and Responsiveness</strong> - All content images are styled to scale appropriately within their sections, maintaining aspect ratios and preventing overflow issues on smaller screens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Button Styling</strong> - The back-to-top button is styled with a fixed position to remain accessible regardless of scroll position, and features hover feedback to improve usability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
                    <p>The content page features several interactive elements designed to improve usability. Goal cards have subtle hover animations that provide feedback when users interact with them. The side navigation highlights the current section based on scroll position, helping users maintain context within the lengthy page.</p>
                    
                    <p>The color coding of goal headers with the official Sustainable Development Goal 2 (#DDA63A) orange color creates visual consistency with international zero hunger initiatives while maintaining our brand identity.</p>

                    <h3>🟡 Navigation Consistency</h3>
                    <p><strong> Challenge:</strong> </p>
                    <p>One of the main challenges I faced was keeping the navigation consistent across all pages while adapting it to different content layouts. Each page had its own unique structure, which sometimes conflicted with the standard navigation design.</p>
                    <p><strong> Solution:</strong> </p>
                    <p>To overcome this, I created a unified navigation component and placed its styling in a separate CSS file. This allowed me to import the same navigation styling across pages, ensuring consistency, while still being able to add specific overrides where needed for special cases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> </p>
                    <p>I realised how important it is to plan modular components from the very start of a project. Doing so makes it much easier to maintain consistency across a large website and saves time in the long run.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🟡 Responsive Goal Cards</h3>
                    <p><strong> Challenge:</strong></p>
                    <p>Designing the goal cards to look good on all devices was tricky. I needed them to display in a neat 3×3 grid on desktop screens, but they also had to reorganise cleanly into 2 columns or 1 column on tablets and mobile without losing visual appeal or readability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>I implemented a flexible CSS Grid layout with well-defined breakpoints. Adding minimum and maximum width constraints ensured that each card resized gracefully, keeping the design balanced and user-friendly on every screen size.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
                    <P>I learned the value of testing designs on multiple devices throughout development. This approach helped identify layout issues early, preventing major rework at the end.</P>
                    
                    <h3>🟡 Image Optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong></p>
                    <p>Another challenge was balancing image quality with page performance. I wanted background and content images to create a strong visual impact, but large file sizes could slow down page loading times, negatively affecting user experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>To solve this, I used SVGs for icons to keep them crisp at any size, and optimised JPG compression for larger background images. I also applied proper sizing techniques and used lazy loading where appropriate to improve page performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
                    <p>This experience taught me that performance considerations shouldn’t come as an afterthought. They need to be integrated into the design process from the beginning to achieve both visual impact and fast loading times effectively.

                <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
                <div class="accessibility-section">
                    <p>Accessibility was a key consideration throughout the development process. The following techniques were employed to ensure the website is usable by as many people as possible:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
                    <p>All pages utilize proper semantic HTML elements to provide clear structure for screen readers. This includes using appropriate heading levels, section elements, and ARIA roles where necessary.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
                    <p>Text elements maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against their backgrounds, exceeding WCAG AA requirements. This was verified using contrast checking tools during development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
                    <p>All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation with visible focus states to assist keyboard users in understanding their current position on the page.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Alternative Text</h3>
                    <p>All images include descriptive alt text, providing context for screen reader users. Decorative images use empty alt attributes to prevent unnecessary verbosity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                    <p>The site is fully responsive and supports text resizing up to 200% without loss of content or functionality, accommodating users who need larger text.</p>

                        <li>No collection of sensitive user data without proper disclosure</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>While the site is currently a demonstration project, all development practices were implemented with the understanding that they would need to meet institutional web publishing standards in a production environment.</p>
